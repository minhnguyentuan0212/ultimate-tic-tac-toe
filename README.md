# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
## Assignment 1: Implement N queens solver using three algorithms
In this assignment, I implement three algorithms and compare time execution between those algorithms through charts:
- Depth First Search Algorithm
- Breath First Search Algorithm
- A Heuristic Search Algorithm
## Assignment 2: Implement game playing agent for Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe
- In this assignment, I implement Minimax Algorithm to fight random agent.
- The game play is in main.py where my minimax implementation is in _2113443_-2110583_2110359_2110051.py file.
## Assignment 3: Implement game playing agent for Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe using Machine Learning
- For this assignment, I use Q-learning to implement an agent to play with random agent and train it.
- Although the result is not well enough due to short training time, but when we train our model for a long time, it can beat random agent.
